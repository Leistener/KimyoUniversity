    about_description: 'In 1933, it was established in Tashkent under the name of the Institute of Chemistry. under this name since 1998. On the basis of the institute, a number of specialized scientific research institutes, including alkaloid chemistry, cotton chemistry and polymer chemistry and physical chemistry laboratories of the institute, the Institute of Chemistry of Plant Substances of the Academy of Sciences of Uzbekistan were separated (1956), in 1959 the Institute of Chemistry and Technology of Cotton Cellulose, in 1965 In 2010, the Central Asian Oil Refining Institute (now the Chemical Pharmaceutical Institute of Uzbekistan named after A. Sultanov) was established on the basis of a petrochemical laboratory. In 1934, scientists of the institute discovered the alkylation reaction of aromatic hydrocarbons with alcohols. In 1938, the acid-base theory was announced (M.I. Usanovich). The results of scientific research carried out in the institute in recent years, including oil and oil product diluents, solvents based on gas condensates, "K9" drug, technology for obtaining water- and oil-soluble surfactants, seed treatment, multi-purpose catalysts, porous vermiculite, oil and extraction of iodine from hydrothermal waters, simple superphosphate from Central Kyzylkum phosphorites, complex and organomineral fertilizers containing phosphorus, calcium, nitrogen ("Azobiocom" and others), stimulants of the "Hasil" series, production technologies of "Sihat", "Sardor" defoliants, chemistry, put into practice in oil refining, food industries, oil factories, drilling equipment, agriculture, construction materials production enterprises.',
